# What does it do?

This project endeavors to keep the results of a Gmail search synchronized with a spreadsheet.

I'm also toying with the idea of supporting the use case of an on-call rotation.

# How do I use it?

1. Create a spreadsheet and make a note of the document ID.
1. Create a new project on <https://script.google.com>.
1. Add `main.gs` to the project.
1. Customize the constants at the top of the script.
1. Run the script!
    * Select the `main()` function from the dropdown.
    * Click the "Run" button.
